# Introduction

::: notes
In this week's module, we delve into a critical and increasingly
relevant topic -- Data Feminism and Algorithms! As we continue to
navigate the complexities of data ethics, governance, and
responsibility, it is essential to recognize how power, privilege, and
inequality are embedded in the systems we design, the data we collect,
and the algorithms we deploy.

In this module, we will explore the principles of data feminism, examine
case studies that highlight the gendered and intersectional impacts of
algorithms, and discuss strategies for designing more equitable and
accountable data systems.

# In Today's World [*Data is Power*]{style="color: blue;"}

::: notes
Data is becoming an incredible form of power in today's world. BUT that
power remains incredibly uneven and more specifically the power of data
is being wielded by a small and homogeneous group of institutions,
corporations, and well-resourced governments usually for their own
benefits as these people have the resources to design and deploy these
data systems and usually it comes at the expenses of everyone else.

This is where the role of feminism, intersectionality, and data feminism
comes in!

## What is Feminism?

`Feminism entails a belief in the equality of all genders`

`Feminism is also about Power`

::: notes
Feminism entails a belief in the equality of all gender which includes
women and men, as well as Two Spirit, genderqueer, travesti, nonbinary
people, and more.

Until gender equality was realized in the world, there were *different
waves of feminism* that resulted into this goal of equality a reality.

Feminism and intersectional feminism in particular are focused on
identifying these imbalance of power and structural forces that caused
them and overcoming those.

The brittleness of AI systems which is defined as this idea that AI
systems are optimized for certain scenarios or certain groups and break
in other instances.

People when talk about this brittleness they are often sort of surprised
that why that is happening? The basic idea that systems — be it social
systems, governmental systems, or institutional systems are optimized
for certain groups and not others. That is not a surprise to feminists.
Also, the basic idea of bias in training data where people wonders how
these effect of this biases can occur with such surprise but the idea of
biases are pretty much baked into the cultural record. And this is
really the ground truth of much feminist work.

Feminism is an essential tool in our toolbox as a data steward if we
want to manage, curate, and create such sort of liberatory data science
or AI infused projects.

## Intersectionality {.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}
`Intersectionality is a metaphor for understanding the ways that multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among conventional ways of thinking`
(Crenshaw, K.W., 1989)

`Intersectional feminism is not only about women or even only about gender. It is about power who Has it and who Does Not`

:::

::: notes
Let's circle back to the important concept of `intersectional feminism`
mentioned in the last slide.

`Intersectional Feminism` resulted from the work of *women of color
feminists, and Black feminists* in the United States in particular.

This idea—that different aspects of identity (like race, gender, class,
disability, or sexuality) overlap to shape people's experiences—is
called intersectionality. The term was introduced by legal scholar
Kimberlé Crenshaw to explain how laws and policies often fail to protect
people who belonged to multiple marginalized groups.

The video on the slide shows the viral video posted on Twitter (now X)
in 2017 where a dark colored skinned man tries to use automatic soap
dispenser in men’s bathroom but the soap dispenser only “sees” light
color, not dark.

To a viewer with light skin, the video is shocking. To a viewer with
dark skin, **this video is a confirmation of the technology bias they
have struggled with for years**.

Every kind of sensor technology, from facial recognition to automatic
faucets tends to work better on light skin than on dark skin. This
problem has its historical roots in FILM TECHNOLOGY and old-school
technology with computer vision built on.

Up until 1970, dark skin looked muddy on film because Kodak used
pictures called “Shirley cards” to tune the film- processing machines in
photo labs. Kodak did not tune for darker skin, because institutional
racism ran deep.

So, Kodak made change in response to customers in furniture industry as
they complained walnut & mahogany furniture looked muddy in catalog
photographs!

As you start to recognise the role that unconscious bias plays in
technology world. Technology is often built by small, homogeneous group
of people; eg. soap dispenser might be developed by all light skinned
group of people who tested it on themselves and it worked and assumed
that it would work for everyone else!

::: notes
Data plays a critical role in shaping AI systems, and biases in data can
lead to biased AI outcomes. Since AI models learn patterns and make
decisions based on the data they are trained on, any biases present in
the data can be amplified or perpetuated by the AI.

There are various types of biases that might led to algorthmic biasness
such as:

1.  **Response or Activity Bias:** It occurs in the content generated by
    humans such as tweets, reviews, posts, etc. As only a small
    proportion of people within particular demographic groups and
    geographic areas contribute to opinion, content, and preferences
    that are unlikely to reflect the opinions of the whole population,
    this can lead to response or activity bias.

2.  **Selection Bias Due to Feedback Loops:** It occurs when a model
    itself influences the generation of data that is used to train it,
    such as a ranking system or recommender system. Machine learning
    models have built-in feedback loops, where the generated data is fed
    back into the system as training data for the model and is
    influenced by the user’s responses. The user’s responses are used to
    generate label examples by tracking their views, clicks, and
    scrolls. This bias tends to favor models that generated the data
    when evaluated using held-out samples from this data and homogenizes
    user’s behavior over time.

3.  **Bias Due to System Drift:** It occurs when the model or algorithm
    changes how users interact with the system over time, for instance,
    the failure of Google Flu Trends for influenza-like illness based on
    search data to forecast the expected number of flu cases for a
    season. It is of two types:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(a) Concept Drift: It occurs when the target or concept being learned is
    changed, such as the definition of fraud changes in fraud prediction
    system.
(b) Model Drift: It occurs when there is a change in the user
    interaction model, such as adding new modes of user interaction like
    share or like buttons or the addition of search assist feature.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  **Omitted Variable Bias:** It occurs when the vital attributes that
    influence the outcome are missing and happens when data generation
    relies on human input, or the process that records the data does not
    have access to the attributes due to privacy concerns.

5.  **Societal Bias:** It occurs when humans produce content on the web
    and social media, such as gender or race stereotypes.

## Fighting Bias in Algorithms

{{< video https://youtu.be/eRUEVYndh9c?si=1R6UXXKZ5vcTrAt4 width="800" height="500">}}

::: notes
In this video by Joy Buolamwini shared her experience while working with
facial analysis software, and noticed a problem: the software didn't
detect her face -- because the *people who coded the algorithm hadn't
taught it to identify a broad range of skin tones and facial
structures.*

This is a very popular video where the biases in facial analysis
software came in front and demanded for accountability in coding.

From her lab from MIT, they also made a movie called "Coded Bias" which
was released in 2020 and is one of the task for you to watch this week!
In that movie, Joy Buolamwini and others from MIT shares more in depth
about the biases that can be embedded into technology like facial
recognition and highlights how such technology systems can cause
problems for vulnerable groups as due to bias within the code.

Data Feminism is a framework and approach to data science that applies
feminist principles to the analysis and interpretation of data. It
critiques traditional data practices that often reinforce existing power
structures, inequalities, and biases, and instead advocates for more
equitable, inclusive, and socially just ways of working with data. The
concept was popularized by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein in
their book Data Feminism (2020).

Thus, data feminism is an approach to data science that seeks to make
data more fair, ethical, and inclusive. It challenges the idea that data
is neutral and instead asks:

-   Who is collecting the data?
-   Whose experiences are being represented—or ignored?
-   How do biases in data and algorithms affect different groups?

`Intersectionality in data science helps us to`:

-   **Avoid oversimplified conclusions**: If we only look at "women" as
    a single group, we might miss how race, disability, or economic
    status shape their experiences differently.
-   **Uncover hidden biases in datasets**: Many AI systems perform
    poorly for people from marginalized communities because they were
    trained on data that didn't include them.
-   **Ensure more just and ethical decision-making**: From hiring
    algorithms to healthcare predictions, considering intersectionality
    prevents data from reinforcing existing inequalities.

## Data Feminism for AI

`7 Principles of Data Feminism` (Klein & D'Ignazio, 2024)

<div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

`Principle 1: Examine Power`: Analyzing how power operates in the world

[Example: Facial Recognition Bias]{style="color: orange;"}

`Principle 2: Challenge Power`: Challenging power and working towards
justice

[Example: Gender Data Gap in Medicine]{style="color: orange;"}

::: notes
All the large models, AI, and algorithms, we are seeing right now are
ultimately **powered by data**. Many of the biases and the inequalities
that we see these models reproducing in the world are related to
problems with data.

Here are few principles/best practices of data feminism to consider
while managing, curation, and working with data to avoid the said
biases:

`The first principle is to` --

**Examine Power:** This principle emphasizes the importance of analyzing
how power operates within data systems. It encourages scrutiny of who
controls data collection, analysis, and dissemination, and how these
processes may reinforce existing inequalities.

For example, researchers such as Joy Buolamwini (introduced earlier)
examined power dynamics in AI by exposing racial and gender biases in
commercial facial recognition systems. Her work showed that these
systems had higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals, revealing
the unequal power distribution in AI development and testing.

`The second principle is to` --

**Challenge Power:** Building upon the examination of power structures,
this principle advocates for actively challenging and dismantling unjust
systems. It calls for using data to expose and address inequalities,
striving toward social justice.

For instance, medical research has historically used male bodies as the
default, leading to misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments for women.
Initiatives like the [WHAM (Women’s Health Access Matters)
project](https://whamnow.org/)challenge this imbalance by advocating for
more sex-disaggregated data in health research to improve outcomes for
women.

## Data Feminism for AI (Cont.)

`Principle 3: Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies`: Data feminism requires
us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting
and classification that perpetuate oppression.

[Example: Non-Binary Gender Categories in
Surveys]{style="color: orange;"}

`Principle 4: Elevate Emotion and Embodiment`: Data feminism teaches us
to value multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes
from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.

[Example: Indigenous Data Sovereignty]{style="color: orange;"}

::: notes
`The third principle is to` --

**Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies:** This principle challenges
traditional binary classifications and hierarchical structures in data.
It promotes the recognition of complexity and the avoidance of
oversimplification, encouraging more nuanced and inclusive data
representations.

For instance, in traditional data collection often forces people into
rigid categories (e.g., male/female). Some organizations, such as the
Canadian government, have introduced non-binary gender options in
official surveys and documents, recognizing that gender exists beyond
binary classifications.

`The fourth principle is to` --

**Elevate Emotion and Embodiment:** Data feminism recognizes the value
of emotions and embodied experiences as legitimate sources of knowledge.
This principle urges the inclusion of diverse perspectives and the
acknowledgment of subjective experiences in data work.

For example, many Indigenous communities, such as those involved in the
[CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics)](https://www.gida-global.org/care), push for
data governance models that respect their cultural and emotional
relationship with land, heritage, and identity, rather than treating
data as purely objective and extractive. We will discuss more on CARE
principles in future modules.

## Data Feminism for AI (Cont.)

`Principle 5: Embrace Pluralism`: Data feminism insists that the most
complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives, with
priority given to local, Indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing.

[Example: Community-Based AI Models for Language
Preservation]{style="color: orange;"}

`Principle 6: Consider Context`: Data feminism asserts that data are not
neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations,
and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis.

[Example: Predictive Policing Risks]{style="color: orange;"}

::: notes
`The fifth principle is to` --

**Embrace Pluralism:** Emphasizing the importance of multiple
perspectives, this principle advocates for the inclusion of diverse
voices in data processes. It supports collaborative approaches that
respect and integrate different forms of knowledge.

For instance, AI models trained on dominant languages often marginalize
indigenous and minority languages. Initiatives like [Mozilla’s Common
Voice project](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en) invite speakers of
underrepresented languages to contribute voice data, making AI more
inclusive and representative.

`The sixth principle is to` --

**Consider Context:** Data does not exist in a vacuum; this principle
highlights the necessity of situating data within its specific social,
cultural, and historical contexts. Understanding these contexts is
crucial for accurate interpretation and ethical application.

For instance, predictive policing algorithms trained on historical crime
data often reinforce systemic biases, leading to over-policing of
marginalized communities. Studies from organizations like [AI Now
Institute highlight how removing context (e.g., historical racial bias
in policing) results in unfair AI
outcomes](https://ainowinstitute.org/publication/dirty-data-bad-predictions-how-civil-rights-violations-impact-police-data).

## Data Feminism for AI (Cont.)

`Principle 7: Make Labor Visible`: The work of data science, like all
work in the world, is the work of many hands. Data feminism makes this
labor visible so that it can be recognized and valued.

[Example: Crowdsourced Data Labeling in AI]{style="color: orange;"}

AI.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3630106.3658543). FAccT '24
:::

::: notes
`The seventh principle is to` --

**Make Labor Visible:** Often, the labor involved in data work is hidden
or undervalued. This principle calls for acknowledging and valuing the
contributions of all individuals involved in data processes, from data
collectors to analysts.

For instance, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT require massive
datasets that must be cleaned, labeled, and moderated by human workers.
These workers, often located in the Global South, are paid low wages to
review harmful content, annotate images, or fine-tune models—tasks that
are critical but rarely acknowledged in discussions about AI
advancements as covered in [this
report](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/).

This principle calls for recognizing and fairly compensating this labor.
The report aligns with this principle by exposing the hidden workforce
behind AI and advocating for more ethical labor practices, such as fair
wages, labor protections, and transparency in AI development.

        Datsets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)
:::

::: notes
One of the downstream effects of the privilege hazard—the risks incurred
when people from dominant groups create most of our data products—is not
only that datasets are biased or unrepresentative, but that they never
get collected at all. Mimi Onuoha—an artist, designer, and educator—has
long been asking *who questions* about data science.

Her project, The Library of Missing Datasets (**IMAGE ON LEFT**), is a
list of datasets that one might expect to already exist in the world,
because they help to address pressing social issues, but that in reality
have never been created.

The project exists as a website and as an art object. The latter
consists of a file cabinet filled with folders labeled with phrases
like:

-   “People excluded from public housing because of criminal records”

-   “Mobility for older adults with physical disabilities or cognitive
    impairments” and

-   “Total number of local and state police departments using stingray
    phone trackers (IMSI-catchers)”

Visitors can tab through the folders and remove any particular folder of
interest, only to reveal that it is empty. They all are. The datasets
that should be there are `“missing.”`

By compiling a list of the datasets that are missing from our “otherwise
data- saturated” world, Onuoha explains,

> “we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important”
> and what is not.

> “Spots that we’ve left blank reveal our hidden social biases and
> indifferences". And by calling attention to these datasets as
> “missing,” she also calls attention to how the matrix of domination
> encodes these “social biases and indifferences” across all levels of
> society.

Another example (**IMAGE ON RIGHT**) on the uses of islamic art for text
and image models which shows that inspite of the wide variety of actual
islamic Art in the world, the range of images that these models are able
to create are in fact quite narrow. This is because of multiple layers
of COLONIAL POWER that contribute to the training data that we can
access today.

So, first the power of the European explorers to initially decide which
artifacts they liked when they encountered them and therefore to sort of
select for preservation and which ones would not be preserved and
therefore not still exist into the present. Then there is a Power of
World's Major ART MUSEUMS which are themselves Colonial institutions.
So, these are the institutions deciding which among tens of thousands of
artifacts in their holdings should be digitized so that we have access
to digital versions of them.

Then you feed all this data into these text-to-image models. When these
models are asked to produce Islamic Art -- you get very limited examples
and with the colonial viewpoint embedded inside and these end up
confirming a very narrow view of what matters in the world of Islamic
Art and what does not.

The *who question* in this case is:
`Who benefits from data science and who is overlooked?` Examining those
gaps can sometimes mean calling out missing datasets; characterizing
them; and advocating for filling them. At other times, it can mean
collecting the missing data yourself!

These datasets are missing for a reason and that reason is the profound
imbalance of Power with respect to data collection in today's world.

Who has this Power? Generally speaking, its governments, moneyed
institutions, cooperation – the ***people with resources to design and
deploy*** these data systems. Whereas, minoritized groups do not have
the ability to collect data at scale on the problems that matter to them
or to us.

This is why the feminist approach to data and to AI always needs to
begin with this analysis of power. Because far too often the datasets
that we can access and in turn the models that they are used to train;
and then ask research questions using these models that have been
developed – all of these things are already overdetermined by the
imbalance of power that we face in the world.

These examples show what happens when unequal power surrounding data
creation, curation, and preservation is allowed to compound and accrue
and accumulate.

# ![](images/future.png)

::: notes
We in academia are only experiencing the corporate capture of AI
research -- its design, development, regulation, or the lack thereof.

The recent development in AI research and AI systems along with all of
their compute requirements have brought more considerations to the
floor.

For example, the environmental cost of training these systems which take
our already limited natural resources like water and energy away from
people and communities towards cooling data centers & GPUs.

Then there is human cost. We have known for several years how Amazon
played role in cloud storage for Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE). How Google developed technology to make drones Stripes more
accurate -- which they then sold it to the US government. This was
Project Maven which you might recall was a source of Google led worker
protest to end terminate that contract.

But now we are seeing this nearly identical object detection software
being put to use right now both in Ukraine and in Gaza -- which people
are describing as the first AI Wars.

It is really worth pausing for a moment and reflect on how the ultimate
use case is for the set of technologies that are truly intended to
benefit humanity. As it turns out causing the literal destruction of
humanity instead.

I would like to end this lecture on a hopeful note that these **AI
systems are incredibly powerful but they are only as powerful as the**

-   data on which they are trained;
-   the conditions under which they are put to use; and
-   the context in which and for which they are developed.

If we are going to imagine alternative conditions for their development
and alternative contexts for their use then I think feminism has a very
strong & real role to play. These are contexts that empower rather than
dis-empower.

These are one that rebalance the existing structures of power that
affect our world today. It is an interventionist & political one ---
technology is not NEUTRAL. None of the choices that we make are. In this
particular case, it is not neutral because it challenges these default
settings of models, datasets, and systems -- it does so with a goal
towards -- Designing technology that works towards liberation and not
just resource extraction.
