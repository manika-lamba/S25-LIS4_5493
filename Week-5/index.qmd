# Introduction

![](images/clipboard-3172885141.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Beginning this week we will begin to learn more about the practical
aspects of the data life cycle.

In Module 4.1, we will learn about how to support research or
researchers as data stewards. The first phase of the data life cycle
after planning the project is to `COLLECT` the data.

Data stewards support researchers and research projects by providing
guidance about how to `ORGANIZE, STRUCTURE, AND STORE` the data of the
project. In this lecture, I will introduce you to these three aspects of
supporting the collection of data, as well as best practices and common
issues.

We are going to take a user-centered approach to organizing and
structuring the data. We will discuss data interviews and we will
examine different data structures and how to decide which is best to use
for collecting the data.

You will also learn about common errors in data. The DataOne lecture
will provide additional examples of data structural issues and common
errors in data files.

Lastly, we will examine data storage options and best practices related
to storing data.

## Organizing Data

![](images/clipboard-3642868022.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Data stewards support the collection of data by assisting the researcher
in developing structures for organizing and structuring the data.

They also provide best practices for storing data. Borgman and her
colleagues have conducted research studies to learn more about how
specific groups of researchers develop research projects and the unique
data life cycle needs of these groups. Read the Borgman reading to learn
more.

As you read think about the issues associated with developing research
specific data structure(s) versus using those used by others in the
discipline. Are there any issues you can think of related to customized
data structures?

Some common questions asked by data stewards during data interviews are
shown on this slide. For example,

-   what is the story behind the data and how will it be used?
-   what is the form and format of the data?
-   who are the potential audiences for the data?
-   what is the expected lifespan of the dataset(s)?
-   how will the data be used, re-used, or repurposed?

These are all important questions to ask when beginning a conversation
about the data of a research project and the researcher’s expectations
for data throughout the data life cycle.

These questions are helpful when guiding the organization, structuring
and storage of data, as well as when developing a data management plan.
:::

## Organizing Data (Cont.) {.smaller}

`Henderson (2017)`

-   How large is the data set(s) and what is expected rate of growth?

-   Does the data contain sensitive information?

-   What publications or discoveries have resulted from the data?

-   How should the data be made accessible?

-   Who owns the data?

-   Types of data created or captured (experimental, qualitative,
    modeling, etc.) and how will it be captured or processed?

-   Contextual details about the data to make it meaningful to other
    users (metadata, file formatting, naming conventions)?

-   Storage, backup, and security plans (Where and on what media will it
    be stored? Backup plans for the data? How will data security be
    managed and by whom?)

-   Privacy/Protection (Ethical and privacy concerns, sensitive data,
    IRB issues, anonymization of data?)

-   Policies and restrictions related to access and re-use (gaining
    access to the data)?

-   Long term plan for preservation and maintenance of data?

::: notes
This slide presents other important, more in depth questions that would
be asked of researchers to determine the data organization needs such as

-   who owns the data?
-   does the data contain sensitive information that should be
    anonymized?
-   how large is the dataset(s)?
-   what is the expected rate of growth; as well as questions related to
    outcomes of the research?

Other critical questions to ask. For example, types of data that will be
captured is an important starting point to determine appropriate data
software or file formats to use for organizing data.

Adding in metadata and following consistent file formatting and naming
conventions are also important to provide context to data and make it
useful to many users and uses.

Policies and plans for data storage, backup, and security should be
established early in the project. It is essential to know who is
responsible for storage, backup and securing the data.

Other policies related to access and re-use and long time preservation
should be determined early but may also change as the project moves out
of the research stage and into the preservation stage.
:::

## Organizing Data Best Practices

![](images/clipboard-2366412557.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Henderson, Ch-3 presents these useful best practices when working with
data. These best practices should guide all stages of the data life
cycle during the research project.

One best practice that is essential is to preserve raw data files and
only work on copies of the file, ensuring that if errors result in the
data then the raw data is still available to use to start over.

This preserves the integrity of the data for future users/uses. See also
the RDM for Busy People file on the Canvas site for this module for a
useful handout on data organization practices.

One additional comment, funders or institutions may have additional
requirements for how data are organized. Be sure you are aware of these
expectations.
:::

## Structuring Data

`The structure of the data should be based on the project, audience, uses of the data and expected research outcomes`

-   Choose a structure or software that is appropriate to the type(s) of
    data being collected AND how it will be analyzed
-   Be aware of common issues of data structuring
-   Adhere to best practices for using raw and processed data files
-   Document any processing done to files, copies made, new files
    developed, etc.

::: notes
Now let’s talk about guiding the researcher’s choice for structuring the
data. The structure of the data should be based on the project,
audience, uses of the data and expected research outcomes.

You should choose a structure or software that is appropriate to the
type(s) of data being collected AND how it will be analyzed. Data
stewards also need to be aware of common issues of data structuring,
which we will discuss on the next few slides and in the DataOne lecture
assigned for this module.

They should also adhere to best practices for using raw and processed
data files and document any processing done to files, copies made, new
files developed, etc. Developing a data dictionary to accompany the
files not only provides needed context for the file but also is a
history of any processing, changes, etc. done to the file.

## Common Issues in Data Structuring

![](images/clipboard-3739627788.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Common issues in data structuring are presented on this slide. The
DataOne lecture, Hogarth chapters and Broman and Woo 2018 article
explain these in more depth as well as provide solutions for each.

-   could help data entry

-   `.csv` or `.tsv` copy would need to be saved.

## Choosing Structure/Software

`Predominant structures for organizing data are:`

-   Spreadsheets
-   Databases
-   Text files
-   Instrument-dependent data outputs that may be spreadsheets or
    databases

::: notes
Choosing the appropriate structure or software for data collection is
critical to the successful use, analysis, and re-use of the data and
outcomes of the research project.

There some predominant structures for organizing data that you have
probably used in projects, such as:

\- Spreadsheets

\- Databases

\- Text files

\- Instrument-dependent data outputs that may be spreadsheets or
databases or some other format specific to the instrument and data
collecting method

Choosing which of these to use is dependent on many variables of the
project, its audience, and desired uses and outputs.
:::

## Spreadsheets vs. Databases

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`Spreadsheets`

-   Mostly numeric data

-   Data requires calculations

-   Statistics and/or statistical analysis is needed

-   Data is non-relational

-   Few people need to work on the data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
`Databases`

-   Large amount of data

-   Long strings of data in a field

-   Records require the use of a primary key or unique identifier

-   Requires relational abilities

-   Many people need to work with the data
:::
:::

::: notes
The two most common forms of data collection are spreadsheets like Excel
or databases like Access or MySQL. The next two slides present guidance
on how to determine which is most appropriate for the data of the
project. You also may need to use more than one form, depending on the
project needs and types of data gathered. Also refer to Hogarth chapters
3 and 4 and the DataOne lecture.
:::

## Spreadsheets vs. Databases (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`Spreadsheets`

-   Great for charts, graphs, calculations

-   Flexible about cell content type – cells in same column can contain
    numbers or text

-   Lack record integrity – can sort a column independently of all
    others

-   Easy to use - but harder to maintain as complexity and size of data
    grows
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
`Databases`

-   Easy to query to select portions of data

-   Data fields are typed. For example, only integers are allowed in
    integer fields

-   Columns cannot be sorted independently of each other

-   Steeper learning curve than a spreadsheet

## Structuring Data

![](images/clipboard-367526936.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This helpful table is from the UK Data Archive’s publication (available
in this module’s readings) and presents recommended file formats
specific to type of data.

This guide is useful during and after the research project and as one
plans for long-term preservation of the data. It covers quantitative,
qualitative, textual, and image and video file formats.
:::

## Storing Data

`There are many options for storing data, some better than others`

-   Personal laptops and computers
-   Network storage
-   External storage devices
-   Removable storage devices
-   Remote storage
-   Physical storage
-   Cloud storage
-   LOCKSS

::: notes
Storing data is the third aspect of organizing data we will discuss in
this module.

There are many options for storing data during the research project,
some better than others. Long-term storage of data includes additional
options not listed on this slide such as an institutional repository,
like ShareOK that you learned about last module, or a discipline
specific repository. We will address how to choose long-term storage
options later in the semester.

As you review these options think about the potential issues of data
loss, data corruption, data security and access related to each.

For example, what are the possible issues with using a personal laptop
or desktop computer for storing the research data? Is using a removable
storage device like a USB drive a safe option?

The last bullet on this slide is [LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Saves
Stuff)](https://www.lockss.org/) or Saves Sanity!. Best practice is to
make several copies (at a minimum three copies) of the data files (raw
and any copies made) and storing them in different places, such as off
site, in the cloud, etc.

The Henderson and Oliver & Harvey chapters provide more discussion on
storage options and potential issues with each.
:::

## Storing Data (Cont.)

`Backing up raw and copies of data is essential!`

-   Full backup of all files

-   Differential incremental backup of files changed since last
    incremental or full backup

-   Cumulative incremental backup of files changed since last full
    backup

::: notes
Henderson Ch. 5 and Oliver & Harvey, Ch. 14 discuss the importance of
backing up data at all stages of the data life cycle.

As noted on the last slide, it is important to have more than one copy
of each file. It is critical to BACK UP each of the files and to do so
on a regular basis. There are both FULL and INCREMENTAL backups that
should be scheduled.

It is also essential to know who is responsible for conducting the
backups and to set up a schedule that is followed. In a full backup the
entire set of files are backed up.

A full backup should be done at least every six months though some best
practices call for monthly full backups. A differential incremental
backup is done in between a full backup and only backs up any files that
have changed since the last incremental backup or full backup.

A cumulative incremental backup is of files changed since the last full
back up, not the last incremental backup. See the Henderson and Oliver &
Harvey chapters for further discussion on types of backups and best
practices.

# Going Forward

::: notes
In the next module, we will continue our discussion on how to support
researchers in the collection of data by documenting and describing the
dataset(s) during research.

We will review documentation best practices (data dictionaries and
README files), and potential metadata schemes to use to ensure use,
re-use, sharing, and interoperability.
