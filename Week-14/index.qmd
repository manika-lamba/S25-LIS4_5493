# Introduction

::: notes
Like planning for your taxes, planning for data management will save you
time and headaches in the long run. By the end of this module, you will
be able to identify the components of a good DMP, understand the
importance and purpose of DMPs, and be familiar with the DMP policies of
several funding agencies. Also, you will add to your toolkit some great
resources and tools for data management planning.

Let's go ahead and get started.

::: notes
At this point, you have a good understanding of what is required to
effectively manage data as you move through the research life cycle. As
you know, data management can seem quite the undertaking, when you
consider all the aspects of data management best practice. But data
management does not have to be overwhelming, if you have a data
management plan.

A data management plan or a DMP for short is a formal document that
describes the data produced in the course of a research project. And
outlines the data management strategies that will be implemented both
during the active phase of the research project and after the project
ends.

## Funders

![](images/2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
If you have been involved in a research project supported by a major
funding agency, you probably have a good idea of what should be included
in a DMP. Many funding agencies, particularly federal agencies, now
require grantees to submit a data management plan as part of the
proposal package.

If you think you or your clients may be applying for a grant from the
National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the
Alfred P Sloan Foundation, NASA, the Institute of Museum and Library
Services, The National Endowment for the Humanities, the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation, the Institute of Education Sciences and the
Economic and Social Research Council, the Science and Technology
Facilities Council, the Wellcome Trust, and while the list goes on you
will need to know how to write a comprehensive DMP.

**Even if you won't be participating in funded research, writing a DMP
will encourage you to think carefully about the data management needs of
your research data and plan accordingly.**

::: notes
Just as I mentioned, many funding agencies now require grantees to
submit a data management plan as part of the proposal package
submission. This gives assurances to the funding agency the project data
will be accessible and usable over the long term. They want to see that
you have established a strategy for managing your data throughout the
research lifecycle.

Making plans for how you will collect, document, organize, and preserve
your data are all part of the data management strategy. This is
important for funding agencies, for two primary reasons. The first
reason is transparency and openness. It is an expectation that publicly
funded research data will be discoverable, accessible, and reusable to
the public.

Since they underwrite federally funded grants, it is a government
responsibility to ensure citizens can see where their tax dollars are
spent and allow them to capitalize on the products of these grants. A
data management plan that illustrates how data will be made
discoverable, accessible and reusable supports this responsibility. The
second reason is return on investment.

Making data discoverable, accessible and reusable, maximizes the
research potential of the data and provides greater returns on public
investments and research. Well-managed data allows for verification or
refinement of published research results, reduces the potential for
scientific fraud, promotes new research through the use of existing
data, provides resources for training new researchers and discourages
unintentional redundancy in research. By planning for data management,
these benefits are more likely to be realized.

## Funding Agency Requirements {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`NSF Requirements`

1.  Types of data to be produced for the project
2.  Data and metadata format and content
3.  Policies for access and sharing, including security provisions
4.  Policies and provisions for dissemination and re-use
5.  Plans for archiving, preserving, and providing access to the data

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
`NIH Requirements`

1.  Final dataset formats
2.  Documentation
3.  Analytic tools necessary to use the data
4.  Data sharing agreements
5.  How and when the data will be accessible to others

![](images/5.png)
:::
:::::

::: notes
Let's take a look at the data management policies from a few of the
major US funding agencies.

The National Science Foundation data management plan policy requires
that proposals include a supplementary Data Management Plan document of
no more than two pages. That includes information on five key aspects of
data management. The types of data to be produced for the project, data
and metadata format and content, policies for access and sharing,
including security provisions, policies and provisions for dissemination
and reuse. And plans for archiving, preserving, and providing access to
the data.

The National Institutes of Health requires applicants seeking \$500,000
or more in direct costs to provide a description of how project data
will be made available in a data sharing plan.

This document should describe final dataset formats, documentation,
analytic tools necessary to use the data, data sharing agreements, and
how and when the data will be made accessible to others.

## Funding Agency Requirements (Cont.) {.smaller}

`NEH Requirements`

1.  The data to be produced
2.  How the data will be managed and maintained
3.  Any factors that might impact the researcher's ability to manage the
    data
4.  The types of information that need to be managed and maintained
    alongside the data
5.  How the data will be shared in a timely manner
6.  Facilities used to preserve the data

![](images/7.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The National Endowment for the Humanities summarizes the content of data
management plans they require with two questions that should be
addressed. What data are generated by your research?

And what is your plan for managing these data? To answer these
questions, NEH requires that the DMP describe the data to be produced,
how the data will be managed and maintained during the active phase of
the project, any factors that might impact the researcher's ability to
manage the data, types of information that need to be managed and
maintained alongside the data, how data will be shared in a timely
manner, and the facilities used to preserve the data.

-   Discuss quality assurance protocols
:::
:::::

::: notes
In all of these three data management policies, DMP should describe in
detail all major aspects of data management throughout the research life
cycle. Here is a checklist for a data management plan from the Digital
Curation Center that list questions that should be addressed in the DMP.

`What data will you collect or create?`

To answer this question, you should provide a description of the data,
including the type, format, and volume, with a justification of the
format choice. If there are any storage implications due to the format
or volume of the data. You should include these as well.

`How will the data be collected or created?`

Describe the data collection methods to be used, including the standards
that dictate these methods. You should also discuss your plans for
organizing data files and applying version control, as well as how
quality assurance protocols will be implemented during and after data
collection.

-   Describe provisions for protecting confidentiality

![](dmp3.gif){fig-align="center" width="260"}
:::
:::::

::: notes
`What documentation of metadata will accompany the data?`

It is important to determine what information will be required to ensure
that the data be understandable to secondary users of the data, or for
you and your team in the future. In other words, you should describe the
type of documentation that will be needed to accompany the data in order
to interpret and use them.

These documents might include a description of the methodologies, a
codebook that provides variable and value definitions, questionnaires or
instruments, or analysis procedures.

`How will you manage any ethical issues?`

The DMP should demonstrate that you have considered critical issues
related to laws and guidelines. Regarding the protection of human
subjects. If your project will conduct research involving human
participants, you need to describe provisions for protecting their
confidentiality. This should include strategies for handling and storing
sensitive data, restricting access to sensitive data, and preparing
de-indentified datasets for sharing.

-   Describe provisions for storage
-   Describe plans for systematic backups
:::
:::::

::: notes
`How will you manage copyright and intellectual property rights issues?`

This is where legal issues of data ownership need to be addressed.You
need to identify the owner of the data and their conditions for using
the data. If you are reusing third-party data particularly property
data. You should discuss permissions with the data producer.

`How will the data be stored and backed up during research?`

To answer this question, you should describe provisions for storage. And
the degree to which they are adequate for the type and size of your
data. Provisions for storage should include plans for systematic back
ups of the data files.

:::
:::::

::: notes
`How will you manage access and security?`

If the data are sensitive or should otherwise be restricted. To
authorize project personnel. You should describe in detail security
measures that will be in place to protect the data. You also need to
describe the standards with which those security measures comply.

`Which data should be retained, shared, and/or preserved?`

In thinking about how the data will be used by others or by your team in
the future, you should make note of the potential value of the data and
the effort that will be required to prepare the datasets for
preservation and access.

:::
:::::

::: notes
`What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset?`

Answering this question requires you to identify the repository you will
use to archive the data and your plans to prepare and document the data
to ensure that they will be preserved and usable into the foreseeable
future.

`How will you share the data?`

Here you should identify the mechanism you will use to share your data.
Describe how others might find your data and how data files will be
delivered. You should also specify how you would like others to
acknowledge or cite your data.

![](dmp4.gif){fig-align="center" width="260"}
:::

![](images/20.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

::: notes
`Are any restrictions on data sharing required?`

Again, if privacy concerns affect your ability to share project data,
you will need to discuss them and how you will overcome these concerns
to enable data sharing whether by providing anonymized versions of the
data. Requiring a data use agreement or other mechanisms. You may also
choose to place an embargo on the data, to ensure you have exclusive use
of the data for a period of time. If this is the case, you should
explain why this is necessary.

:::
:::::

::: notes
`Who will be responsible for data management?`

Quite simply, you need to identify, by name if possible, who will
oversee the implementation of the data management plan.

`What resources will you require to implement your plan?`

For some projects with complex data, whether due to type, size, or the
fact that project activities are geographically distributed among
different institutions, data management might require specialized
expertise or special equipment.

You may also consider costs associated with performing ongoing data
management tasks, as well as the resources required for long-term
preservation of the data in a repository.

::: notes
If this check list seems overwhelming, don't worry.

There are multiple data management plan tools available to use online
for free. Two of these are the DMPTool produced by the University of
California, Curation Center of the California Digital Library and
DMPOnline developed by the Digital Curation Centre.

The DMPTool allows researchers to create customized data management
plans via a step-by-step wizard based on each funding agency's
requirements. This wizard office resources, help text and suggested
answers based on templates developed and reviewed by information
professionals from the researches institution in the California Digital
Library. 

When funding agency policies change, the DMPTool is updated.
This ensures that the information is up to date and all new requirements
are listed in the DMPTool templates. DMPOnline like the DMPTool is the
DCC's data management planning tool. It offers guidance for researchers
writing DMPs and includes templates specific to the requirements of UK
funding agencies and funding agencies outside the UK. Institutions can
also customize templates via DMPOnline.

Writing a data management plan gets you to think through data management
issues early on in the research life cycle. By considering all of these
issues, you will not only be in compliance with data management
requirements, you will also be better prepared to implement data
management strategies. Even if you aren't required to write a data
management plan, this is a helpful process to do better research.
